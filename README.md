# trader_joes_income_inequality
Ongoing study on the demographics of areas in which Trader Joe's are located. The objective of this study is to highlight the company's pattern of catering to high-income demographics, despite promoting high-quality and low-cost food options that would largely benefit low-income demographics. Work in progress.
